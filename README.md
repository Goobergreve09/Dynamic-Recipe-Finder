## Description

For this Dynamic Recipe Finder, the final project in Web Application Programming I, there are many implementations. It allows the users to search for a recipe based on the ingredients a user inputs, by using the [spoonacular API](https://spoonacular.com/food-api). Then, when the results queue, the user may view the recipe, or add it to favorites by clicking the heart to save them to favorites using local storage. The user can then go to the favorites page to view saved recipes, and remove them if necessary. There is also an integrated timer for cooking, if a user decides they would like to use this functionality.

My motivation for this project was for completing the final assignment in Web Application Programming. I wanted to use skills that I had previously used, and to create a sleek a modern design for this application.
